## Gary: SAT Intro & Prep

### Structure: Reading, Writing, Math

- Dynamic difficulty
- For top 50: at least 1330
- For Ivy League: at least 1530

### Preparation

- Most important: vocabulary, 10,000 words are required for 1400
- Math: most difficult part is like 10th grade, but only 800 is a competitive score
- Module 1 of each section is important since it's in dynamic difficulty, poor performance will lead to easier questions later with score 1380 at most.
