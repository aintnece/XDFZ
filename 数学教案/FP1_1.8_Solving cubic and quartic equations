4. Capable of using long division to divide polynomials.

## 教学过程

### 1. Complex Conjugate Roots Theorem

- If a polynomial has real coefficients and a complex root, then its conjugate is also a root.
- This means that if $ a + bi$ is a root, then $a - bi$ is also a root.

### 2. Roots of Cubic Equations

- A cubic equation can have either 1 real root and 2 complex conjugate roots, or 3 real roots.
- **Example 18**: learn to use long division to divide polynomials.

### 3. Roots of Quartic Equations

- A quartic equation can have either 4 real roots, or 2 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots, or two pairs of complex conjugate roots.
- **Example 19**: learn to use inspection to find roots of quartic equations (comparing coefficients).
- **Example 20**: use long division to divide polynomials.

### 4. Exercise 1l

- Problem 12
- Challenge Problem
