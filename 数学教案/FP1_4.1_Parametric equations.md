# **Parametric Equations**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of parametric equations.
- Understand the relationship between parametric equations and Cartesian equations.
- Understand how to convert between parametric and Cartesian equations.

## Teaching Process

### 1. Introduction to Parametric Equations

- Parametric equations are equations that express the coordinates of points on a curve in the form of an independent variable, usually denoted as $t$.
- The equations are usually given in the form:
  - $x = f(t)$
  - $y = g(t)$

### 2. Example 1

- $x$ and $y$ are expressed in terms of $t$, and calculated respectively.
- The shape of the curve is a parabola.

### 3. Example 2

- Express $t$ as a function of $y$ and substitute it into the equation for $x$.
- The resulting equation is a Cartesian equation.

### 4. Example 3

- Express $t$ as a function of $x$ and substitute it into the equation for $y$, or the other way around.
- The resulting equation is a Cartesian equation for hyperbola.
