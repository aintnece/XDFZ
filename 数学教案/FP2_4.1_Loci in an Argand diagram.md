# **Loci in An Argand Diagram**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand using complex numbers to represent locus in the Argand diagram.
- Learn three different types of loci represented with complex numbers:
  - Circle
  - Perpendicular bisector of a line segment
  - Half-line
- Learn how to find the Cartesian equation of a locus in the Argand diagram.

## Teaching Process

### 1. Introduction to Loci in the Argand Diagram

- The distance between two points in the Argand diagram can be represented as $|z_1 - z_2|$.
- The locus of points $z$ such that $|z - z_0| = r$ is a circle with center $z_0$ and radius $r$.
  - A Cartesian equation of a circle can be derived from $|z - z_0| = r$ by squaring both sides.
- The locus of points $z$ such that $|z - z_1| = |z - z_2|$ is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $z_1$ and $z_2$.
  - A Cartesian equation of a perpendicular bisector can be derived from $|z - z_1| = |z - z_2|$ by calculating the gradient of the normal to the line segment and using the midpoint of the segment.

### 2. Example 1

- Locus of points $z$ is a circle with center $(4,0)$ and radius 5.
- Solve for the Cartesian equation of the circle and use it to find the points on the circle.

### 3. Example 2

- Locus of points $z$ is a circle with center $(5,3)$ and radius 3.
- Solve for the Cartesian equation of the circle.
- The maximum value of $\arg{z}$ is the angle between the tangent lines from the origin to the circle.

### 4. Example 3

- The maximum and minimum values of $|z|$ are the intersection points of the circle with the line that passes through the origin and the center of the circle.

### 5. Example 4

- Locus of points $z$ is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $(3,0)$ and $(0,-1)$.
- Draw the locus on the Argand diagram and find the Cartesian equation of the locus.
- The minimum value of $|z|$ is the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line.

### 6. The third type of locus: half-line

- The locus of points $z$ such that $\arg{z-z_0} = \theta$ is a half-line at an angle $\theta$ to the positive real axis, excluding the point $z_0$.
- The Cartesian equation of the half-line can be derived as $y-y_0=\tan{\theta}(x-x_0)$, where $(x_0,y_0)$ is the point $z_0$ in Cartesian coordinates.

### 7. Example 5

- Locus of points $z$ is a half-line at an angle of $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ to the positive real axis, excluding the point $(-3,-2)$.
- The Cartesian equation is $y+2=-1(x+3)$.
- $|z+3+2i|=10$ is the equation of a circle with center $(-3,-2)$ and radius 10.
