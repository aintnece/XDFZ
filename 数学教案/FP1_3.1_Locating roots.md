# **Locating Roots**

## 教学目标

- Understand from the graph that if a continuous function changes sign over an interval, then it has a root in that interval.

## 教学过程

### 1. Intermediate Value Theorem When $L=0$

- If the function $y=f(x)$ is continuous on the close interval $[a,b]$ and $f(a)f(b)<0$, then there exists at least one root in the interval $(a,b)$.

### 2. Example 1

-Roots can be found in certain intervals by either inspecting the graph or calculating the function values at the endpoints of the intervals.

### 3. Limitations

- The function must be continuous in the interval for the theorem to apply.
- Change of sign in the continuous function only guarantees the existence of **at least one root** in the interval, but not the number of roots.
- Change of sign in the continuous function is **not** a necessary condition for the existence of a root in the interval.

### 4. Example 2

- No sign change in the function values at the endpoints of the interval does not guarantee that there is no root in the interval.
- There are 3 roots actually in the interval $(1.1,1.7)$.
