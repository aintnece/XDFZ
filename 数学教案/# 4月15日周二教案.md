2. Complex number can be seen as an vector from the origin to the point $(x,y)$.

### 新知讲解

#### 1.5 Modulus and Argument of a Complex Number

1. **Definition of modulus and argument**:
   - Modulus: $|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$
   - Argument: $\arg z=\theta=\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$ (with quadrant consideration)
   - Geometric interpretation: modulus is the length of the vector, argument is the angle with the positive x-axis.
2. **Example 12**:
   - Very simple, but why showing the graph?
   - Point out that which quadrant the point is in may affect the argument.
3. **How to determine the argument**:
   - If $z$ lies in the first quadrant, $\arg z=\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$.
   - If $z$ lies in the second quadrant, $\arg z=\pi-\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$.
   - If $z$ lies in the third quadrant, $\arg z=-(\pi+\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x}))$.
   - If $z$ lies in the fourth quadrant, $\arg z=\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$.
4. **Example 13**:
   - Sketch the Argand diagram, showing the position of the number.
   - Here $z$ is in the third quadrant, so $\arg z=-(\pi+\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x}))$.
5. **Example 14**:
   - Point out that result in part c holds for any complex number $z$.

#### Exercise 1F

- Problem 11 and 13.

#### 1.6 Modulus-Argument Form of a Complex Number

1. **Modulus-argument form**: $z=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$, where $r=|z|$ and $\theta=\arg z$.
   - This is a polar form of a complex number.
   - Geometric interpretation: $r$ is the length of the vector, $\theta$ is the angle with the positive x-axis.
2. **Example 15**:
   - Sketch the Argand diagram, showing the position of the number.
   - Find $r$ and $\theta$.
   - Apply $z=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$ to find $z$.
3. **Example 16**:
   - Here $z$ is in the third quadrant, so $\arg z=-(\pi+\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x}))$.

#### Exercise 1G

- Problem 6.

#### 1.7 Complex Roots of Quadratic Equations

1. **Complex roots**: If complex number $z$ is a root of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, then $z^*$ is also a root.
   - This is because the coefficients are real numbers, and the discriminant holds.
   - Quadratic equation can be expressed as $(x-z)(x-z^*)=0$, or $x^2-(z+z^*)x+zz^*=0$.
2. **Example 17**:
   - Use $(x-z)(x-z^*)=0$ to find the quadratic equation.
   - Link results in part c to Chapter 2.

#### Exercise 1H

- Problem 7.
