# **The General Equation of A Parabola**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the general equations of a parabola, including the Cartesian and parametric forms.
- Understand the geometric properties of a parabola.
- Understand the relationship between the focus, directrix, and vertex of a parabola.
- Identify the vertex, focus, and directrix of a parabola from its equation.

## Teaching Process

### 1. Introduction to Parabolas

- As discussed in the previous lesson, a parametric function with the form $x = at^2$ and $y = 2at$ describe a parabola.
- The Cartesian form of a parabola is given by $y^2=4ax$, where $a>0$.
- The curve is symmetric about the x-axis.
- Properties of the parabola: the locus of points where any point on the curve is the same distance from a fixed point, the **focus**, and a fixed line, the **directrix**.
- The focus is located at $(a,0)$ and the directrix is the line $x=-a$.
- The vertex of the parabola is at the origin $(0,0)$.

### 2. Example 4

- Based on the focus $(7,0)$ and directrix $x=-7$, the equation for the parabola is $y^2=4\cdot 7x=28x$.
- Based on the focus $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4},0)$ and directrix $x=-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$, the equation for the parabola is $y^2=4\cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}x=\sqrt{3}x$.

### 3. Example 5

- Based on the equation $y^2=24x$, the focus is at $(6,0)$ and the directrix is $x=-6$.
- Based on the equation $y^2=\sqrt{32}x$, the focus is at $(\sqrt{2},0$) and the directrix is $x=-\sqrt{2}$.

### 4. Example 6

- The distance from the focus $(6,0)$ to point $P$ is $d_1=\sqrt{(x-6)^2+y^2}$.
- The distance from the directrix $x=-6$ to point $P$ is $d_2=|x+6|=x+6$.
- Since $P$ satisfies $d_1=d_2$, we have $\sqrt{(x-6)^2+y^2}=x+6$.
- Squaring both sides gives $(x-6)^2+y^2=(x+6)^2$.
- Expanding both sides gives $x^2-12x+36+y^2=x^2+12x+36$.
- Simplifying gives $y^2=24x$.

### 5. Example 7

- Based on the equation $y^2=8x$, the focus is at $(2,0)$ and the directrix is $x=-2$.
- The line given by point $(8,-8)$ and focus $(2,0) is $y=-\frac{4}{3}x+\frac{8}{3}$.
- Solve for $y^2=8x$ and $y=\frac{4}{3}x-\frac{8}{3}$ simultaneously to find the intersection points $(\frac{1}{2},2)$.
- The midpoint is given by $\left(\frac{8+\frac{1}{2}}{2},\frac{-8+2}{2}\right)=\left(\frac{17}{4},-3\right)$.
