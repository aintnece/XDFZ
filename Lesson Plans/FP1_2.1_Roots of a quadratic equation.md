# **2.1 Roots of a quadratic equation**

## 教学目标

- Understand the relationship between the real coefficients of a quadratic equation and its roots.
- Capable of solving for coefficients of a quadratic equation using Vieta's formulas.

## 教学过程

### 1. Vieta's formulas

- For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the roots $\alpha$ and $\alpha$ satisfy:
  - $\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}$
  - $\alpha \beta = \frac{c}{a}$
- The above formulas holds for complex roots as well.

### 2. **Example 1**

- Utilize Vieta's formulas to calculate operations of complex roots without solving the equation.

### 3. **Example 2**

- Calculate the coefficients of a quadratic equation given its roots.

## Exercise 2A
