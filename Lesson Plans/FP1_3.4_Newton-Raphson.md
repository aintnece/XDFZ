# **The Newton-Raphson Method**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of functions.
- Learn to use the Newton-Raphson formula to calculate the root.

## Teaching Process

### 1. Introduction to the Newton-Raphson Method

- The Newton-Raphson method uses the derivative of a function to find its roots, hence just one point is needed to start the iteration, in stead of two as in the interval bisection and linear interpolation methods.
- The Newton-Raphson formula is given by:

$$
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
$$

- The choice of the initial point is important, as it can affect the convergence of the method. The method converges quadratically if the initial guess is close to the root and the function is well-behaved.
- The root might converge at a much slower rate if the initial guess is close to a local extremum.
- The method can fail to converge if the derivative is zero or if the function is not differentiable at the root.

### 2. Example 7

- Since $p$ is the turning point, so $f'(p) = 0$, and the Newton-Raphson method will fail to converge.
- Find out the derivative of the function $f'(x)=3x^2+4-5$.
