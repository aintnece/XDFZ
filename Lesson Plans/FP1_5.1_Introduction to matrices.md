# **Introduction to Matrices**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of matrices
- Learn three special types of matrices
- Learn how to perform matrix addition and subtraction, and multiplication by a scalar

## Teaching Process

### 1. Introduction to Matrices

- A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
- The size of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns it contains, denoted as $n \times m$, where $n$ is the number of rows and $m$ is the number of columns.
- For example, $\begin{pmatrix}
    2 & 3\\
    4 & 5
\end{pmatrix}$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix, and $\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 4 & -1 & 1\\
    2 & 3 & 0 & 2\\
\end{pmatrix}$ is a $3 \times 4$ matrix.

- A **square matrix** is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns, i.e., $m = n$.
- A **zero matrix** is a matrix in which all elements are zero, denoted as $\mathbf{0}$.
- An **identity matrix** is a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. For example, $\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$ is a $2 \times 2$ identity matrix.

### 2. Example 1

- a: $2 \times 2$ matrix.
- b: $1 \times 3$ matrix.
- c: $2 \times 1$ matrix.
- d: $3 \times 2$ matrix.

### 3. Addition and Subtraction of Matrices

- Matrices can be added or subtracted if they have the same dimensions.
- The sum or subtraction of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is obtained by adding or subtracting their corresponding elements.

### 4. Example 2

- $\begin{pmatrix}
    2 & -1\\
    0 & 3\\
\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}
    -1 & 4\\
    5 & 3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 3\\
    5 & 6
\end{pmatrix}$.

- $\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -3 & 4\\
    2 & 1 & 1\\
\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 2 & 1\\
    5 & 2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -5 & 3\\
   -3 & -1 & -2
\end{pmatrix}$.

### 5. Scalar Multiplication of Matrices

- A matrix can be multiplied by a scalar (a real number) by multiplying each element of the matrix by that scalar.
